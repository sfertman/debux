# Change logs since v0.3.0
:source-language: clojure
:source-highlighter: coderay
:sectnums:

* v0.6.5
** The redundant printing bug related to `dbg` inside `dbgn` fixed.
** Documented: a trick on debugging multiple forms with `dbgn`.

* v0.6.4
** Bug fixed: issue #16
** Bumps `clojure-future-spec 1.9.0` and `cljs-devtools 1.0.0`

* v0.6.3
** The printed format of evaluating the multiple forms in `dbg`/`clog` is changed for
   readability.

* v0.6.2
** The namespace and line number of the source code are relocated to the top line for
   readability.

* v0.6.1
** The namespace and line number of the source code are printed as well in the debux macros.   

* v0.6.0
** Changed: _number_ option of *debux* macros is now applied to not only `seq` data type
   but also all the `coll` data types. (Previously, the _number_ option was applied to
   only `seq` data type.)
*** This change will prevent the elements of the deeply nested massive `coll` data types
    from being printed too much.
** Renamed: `set-print-seq-length!` pass:q[-->] `set-print-length!`

* v0.5.9
** The link:https://github.com/binaryage/cljs-devtools[cljs-devtools] support added.

* v0.5.8
** The `dbg-last` macro added.

   `:skip-form-itself-type.

* v0.5.4
** The `:js` option color in `clog`/`clogn` is changed.

* v0.5.3
** The `:js` option can be used in `clogn` now.

* v0.5.2
** The `:js` option error of `clog` is fixed.

* v0.5.1

   *debux* library on JVM 9 or above.

* v0.5.0
** Multiple `dbgn` or `dbg` can be used together. See <<multiple-use, here>> for details.
** `dbgm` is renamed `dbg-prn` to clarify the meaning. See <<dbg-prn, here>> for details.

** `.cljc` examples are added to `example/src/cljc/example/common.cljc` file.

* v0.4.12

** link:https://github.com/philoskim/debux/issues/9[Issue #9] bug fixed: This error
   occured when the form including `recur` has a `java.lang.Class` type of symbol as
   well. It's now fixed.

* v0.4.10
